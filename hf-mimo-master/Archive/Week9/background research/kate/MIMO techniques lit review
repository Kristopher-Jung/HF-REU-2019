Generally super useful overview: [6]

MIMO techniques outside of HF (... that we’re not using)
Transmission encoding schemes
OFDM (Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing)
Transmits on multiple different subcarrier frequencies within the whole bandwidth
orthogonal/independent for each symbol
Can make ISI arbitrarily small
Sources: [1], [2]
OSTBC (Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding), generalization of Alamouti scheme
Space-time diversity encoding
Does not require channel state information at the transmitter
Sources: [3], [4] (original paper proposing Alamouti scheme)
Receiver Schemes
ML (Maximum Likelihood) Detectors
Minimizes the probability of an incorrect bit, INCREDIBLY time-intensive, examined in our paper
Sphere decoding
Variably faster, slightly worse ML
Trade off accuracy for speed
Example of SD + deep learning: [5]
Linear Equalizers
ZF
MMSE
Successive cancellation (SUC) receivers
Pick a symbol at random and say it’s the right symbol. Remove its propagation from the rest of the received data. 
Noted problem: if your first guess is wrong everything gets very wrong
Sources: [6] (mentioned, not really examined)
Ordered Successive Cancellation Receivers (OSUC)
Better version of SUC, picks the best stream instead of a random one
Sources: [6] (mentioned, not really examined)
