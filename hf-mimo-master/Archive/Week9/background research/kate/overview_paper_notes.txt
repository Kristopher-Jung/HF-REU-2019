Notes from: "An Overview of MIMO Communications—A Key to Gigabit Wireless"

For MIMO, not specifically for HF (i.e. primarily in non-MIMO)
- Transmit strategies
    - Space-Time diversity encoding
        - Alamouti scheme/OSTBC: transmit [s1 s2] followed by [-s2* s1*] from 2 antennas
            - Extracts channel information from repetition of symbols
            - Extends beyond 2 Tx via OSTBC
    - Spatial multiplexing
        - Horizontal Encoding
            - each Tx antenna has a totally different data stream
        - Vertical Encoding
            - requires joint encoding/decoding
- Receiver strategies
    - ML
    - Linear Receivers
        - ZF
        - MMSE
    - Successive cancellation (SUC) receivers
        - Pick a symbol at random and say it’s the right symbol. Remove its propagation from the rest of the received data. 
        - Noted problem: if your first guess is wrong everything gets very wrong
    - Ordered Successive Cancellation Receivers
        - Better version of SUC, picks the best stream instead of a random one
- OFDM
    - Good for frequency-selective fading channels
